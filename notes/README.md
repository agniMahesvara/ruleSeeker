Initially, first level is envisioned as being subdivided into quarters (four sublevels), they being in respectively universalist / humanist aspects: (4 or top) psyche / intellect; (3) time / society; (2) space / biology; and, (1 or bottom) etherial fantasy. The psycho-intellectual top sublevel of first or lunar level is qualificatory and should be where we may return to our Moon proper. The temporo-social sublevel is emphatically actualistic and is ruled by a higher level of United Nations from the free nation of Tibet. The spacio-biological level is reality (still above where we presently exist) and finds strength in Kazakhstan. Our lowest (emphatically fantasy) sublevel recognizes political legitimacy in Euro-American culture, where in the context of literal fantasy we have worlds like J. R. R. Tolkien's Middle-earth and Ed Greenwood's Forgotten Realms designing significant thematics.
