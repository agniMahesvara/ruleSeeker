Foreword 
(to the first Hindi edition) 


Today I am feeling unprecedented happiness to be able to 
present a Hindi edition of Sri Rādhā-krsņa-ganoddeša-dīpikā 
to the faithful readers. The author, Srila Ripa Gosvami, is an 
eternal associate of Sri Saci-nandana Gaurahari, and he is the 
crest jewel in the community of those who relish pure bhakti- 
rasa. This unparalleled scripture is a prominent guide that 
illuminates worship in the wake of the spontaneous devotional 
moods of Vraja. Although its language is profound, it is easy to 
understand. 

Srila Ripa Gosvami’s inherent nature is superlatively 
sweet. He established in this world the innermost desire of Sri 
Caitanya, and he has written a brief yet vital description of 
the names, forms, qualities and different services of Sri Radha’s 
and Sri Krsna’s cherished companions. In the Brhad-bhāga, or 
first part, of this composition, he describes those in vātsalya- 
rasa and madhura-rasa, and in the Laghu-bhāga, or second part, 
he describes those in sakhya-rasa and dāsya-rasa. Sometimes, 
especially in the second part, he depicts in detail the beautiful 
forms of Sri Radha and Sri Govinda, as well as Their bodily 
limbs, Their ornaments and the astonishing paraphernalia used 
by Them. Such a comprehensive description of Sri Krsna and 
His companions will not be found in any other single scripture. 
This book is entitled Sri Radha-krsna-ganoddesa-dipika because 
it briefly introduces the dear associates (gana) of Šrī Radha 
and Sri Krsna.! 

1 Sri Radha-krsna-ganoddesa-dipika literally means ‘a small lamp 


(dipika) that is used for the purpose (uddešya) of illuminating the dear 
associates (gana) of Sri Rādhā and Sri Krsņa. 


er Šrī Rādhā-krsņa-gaņoddeša-dīpikā 


Fortunate living beings who give attention to hearing from 
pure rasika devotees of Vraja the transcendent narrations 
of the Supreme Lord's pastimes, and in whose hearts an 
excessive eagerness thus awakens to devotedly serve Sri Krsna 
in the mood of the residents of Vraja, are qualified to practise 
rāgānugā-bhakti. 

“What are the sweet emotions that Sri Krsna's eternally 
perfected associates have for Him? Is it possible that I may also 
attain a mood such as theirs? How can it be attained?” When 
the moods of the heart are characterised by this type of ardent 
yearning, it is symptomatic of the aforementioned excessive 
eagerness, or greed. 

When, in the sādhaka's life, he comes to such a stage, he 
follows the path revealed by the spiritual authorities. In his 
external body he renders service — such as hearing the glories 
of the Lord and daily chanting the holy name a fixed number of 
times — following in the footsteps of the residents of Vraja like 
Sri Ripa and Sri Sanatana. And internally, in his siddha-deha, 
or perfected spiritual body, he performs mānasī-sevā under 
the guidance of Sri Lalita, Sri Visakha, Sri Ripa Mafijari and 
others. 

To constantly cultivate that mānasī-sevā, or transcendental 
service within the purified mind, it is essential to become 
acquainted with the eternal associates of Sri Radha and Sri 
Krsna and their way of performing loving service to Them. 
This is the information given in this literature. Thus it is not 
an exaggeration to pronounce this scripture as the very beacon 
that guides the devotee who has already attained perfection 
(svarūpa-siddhi), to attain complete maturity in his internal 
service.

Foreword ^ 


A Brief Life History of Srila Rūpa Gosvāmī 


In the pastimes of Sri Gauranga, Srila Ripa Gosvāmī is the 
leader of the six Gosvamis, and in Sri Krsna’s pastimes in Vraja, 
he is Sri Ripa Mañjarī. His ancestors resided in the province of 
Karnataka. For some reason, one of his ancestors left that place 
and came to live in Bengal. Srila Ripa Gosvami appeared in this 
dynasty of Bharadvaja-gotra’s yajurvediya-brahmanas in about 
1411 Sakabda Era (1489 AD) in a village named Moragrama 
Mādhāīpura in Bengal. His father’s name was Kumāra-deva. 
He had two brothers — Srila Sanātana Gosvāmī was elder and 
Anupama, or Vallabha, was younger. Sri Jiva Gosvami was the 
son of Anupama. Even in their childhood, these three brothers 
felt immense attachment to Sri Bhagavan’s lotus feet. 

When they had completed their education and had grown 
to youths, the ruler of Bengal (Gaudadeša) Husain Shah 
became impressed by their sharp intelligence, noble character 
and various other good qualities. He appointed Sri Sanatana 
Gosvami as his prime minister and Sri Ripa Gosvami as his 
private secretary. In 1514 AD, Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu started 
out for Vraja for the first time. On the way, He came to the 
village of Ramakeli, where He met these three brothers. Then, 
instead of continuing to Vrndavana, He returned to Jagannatha 
Puri. Now, having had Mahāprabhu's divine association, Srila 
Rupa Gosvami was tormented by such an eagerness to attain 
Sri Krsna that he abandoned his governmental duties and 
everything else. 

Then, for the second time, Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu 
set out for daršana of Sri Vrndavana. Upon His return 
from Vrndāvana, Sri Ripa Gosvami met Him at Prayāga 


iii 


er Šrī Rādhā-krsņa-gaņoddeša-dīpikā 


(Allahabad). It was there that Mahāprabhu inspired His dear 
Rūpa with a unigue presentation on the eternal fundamental 
principles of bhakti-rasa and then empowered him to expound 


them. A description of this is found in Šrī Caitanya-caritāmrta 


(Madhya-līlā 19.136—7): 


prabhu kahe,—Suna, rüpa, bhaktirasera-laksaņa 
sūtrarūpe kahi, vistāra nā jāya varņana 


pārāpāra-šūnya gambhīra bhaktirasa-sindhu 
tomāya cākhāite tara kahi eka ‘bindu’ 


Sriman Mahāprabhu said, “My dear Ripa, I will tell 
you, in condensed aphorisms, the symptoms of bhakti- 
rasa, because it is not possible to describe them in their 
entirety. This nectarean ocean of the mellows of bhakti 
(bhakti-rasāmrta-sindhu) is so deep and so vast that its 
length or breadth cannot be calculated. I am imparting 
to you just one drop from that ocean.” 


Thus, for ten consecutive days during their stay in Prayāga, 
Šrīman Mahāprabhu presented bhakti-rasa-tattva in a way 
that had no precedent. $rila Rüpa Gosvāmī expounded this 
subject in his Bhakti-rasāmrta-sindhu, Ujjvala-nilamani, Lalita- 
mādhava, Vidagdha-mddhava and other books. 

Srila Ripa Gosvami’s attachment for Sri Caitanya 
Mahāprabhu is extraordinarily deep. Consequently, he is 
naturally renounced from family life, humble, detached from 
sense objects and full of other such exalted qualities for 
which he is famous. Sri Caitanya-caritāmrta, Bhakta-māla 
and other books portray his personal gualities as well as his 
life's achievements. $rila Narottama Thākura Mahāšaya has 
rightfully proclaimed him to be ‘Sri-caitanya mano ’bhista- 
sarnsthāpaka — he who establishes the innermost desire of Sri 


Foreword ^ 


Caitanya Mahaprabhu’s heart’. Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu gave 
him two specific orders: to re-establish the lost places of Sri 
Vraja-mandala, and to write scriptures delineating bhakti. 

While still living in Bengal, he began to compose verses 
for the dramas Lalita-madhava [Sri Krsna’s pastimes in 
Dvarakapuri] and Vidagdha-madhava [His pastimes in Vraja]. 
He planned to combine these dramas, in the hope that they 
would pacify the Vrajavasis’ feelings of separation from Sri 
Krsna. However, at Satyabhāmāpura in Orissa, he received an 
order by Sri Satyabhama-devi to write two separate dramas. 
Then, in Nīlācala (Jagannātha Puri), Mahaprabhu directly 
instructed him to do the same. Only those who are rasika, or able 
to relish the astonishing devotional moods of transcendence, 
can fathom the joy of Sri Caitanya Mahāprabhu when He 
heard these writings of Srīla Rūpa Gosvāmī in the assembly 
of devotees. The Lord fully empowered Sri Ripa, gave him 
the position of ācārya (one who teaches by his own example) 
and sent him to Vrndavana. Thereafter, Sri Rüpa fulfilled the 
Lord's innermost desire. Srila Narottama Thākura Mahāšaya 
has written: 


$ri-caitanya mano 'bhistam sthāpitam yena bhūtale 
svayam rüpah kadā mahyam dadāti svapadantikam 


When will Sti Ripa Gosvami give me the shelter of his 
lotus feet? Because he understood the innermost desire 
of Šrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, he was able to establish 
His mission in this world and is very dear to the Lord. 


The following are some of the books composed by $ri Rüpa 
Gosvāmī: Bhakti-rasāmrta-sindhu, | Ujjvala-nilamani, | Laghu- 
bhāgavatāmrtam, Vidagdha-mādhava, Lalita-mādhava, Nikufija- 
rahasya-stava,  Stavamālā,  Mathurā-māhātmya,  Padyāvalī, 


er Šrī Rādhā-krsņa-gaņoddeša-dīpikā 


Uddava-sandeša, Hamsadüta, Dānakeli-kaumudī, Krsņajanma- 
tithi-vidhi, Prayuktakhyat-mafijari and Nātaka-candrikā.

(o 
The Vaisnava-tosani-tika's Mention of 
Sri Radha-krsna-ganoddesa-dipika 


At the end of Sri Sanātana Gosvami’s Vaisnava-tosani 
commentary on the Tenth Canto of Srīmad-Bhāgavatam, there 
is a description of the books composed by Srila Ripa Gosvami: 


tayoranujasrstesu kāvyam $ri-hamsadütakam 
brhad laghutayā khyātā $ri-ganoddesa-dipika 


The meaning is that $ri Sanātana Gosvāmī's younger brother, 
Šrīla Rüpa Gosvāmī, has written a poetic work named Šrī 
Harmsadūta, as well as Šrī Rādhā-krsņa-ganoddeša-dīpikā, which 
is famous for its divisions named Brhad and Laghu. 

The Fifth Wave of Bhakti-ratnākara also mentions Sri 
Rādhā-krsņa-gaņoddeša-dīpikā. 


Ge 


Srila Ripa Gosvāmī's original composition of this book is 
in the Sanskrit language. Although many editions with Bengali 
translations have been published, in almost all of them, textual 
variations, changes of seguence, additional texts or omitted 
texts can be detected. We have revised the book and as far as 
possible, systematically arranged it and ornamented some of 
the verses with commentaries. I sincerely hope that Srila Rapa 
Gosvāmī and the rūpānugā guruvarga (spiritual teachers guided 
by him) will be pleased by this endeavour and bestow upon us 
their merciful blessings. Then the readers' study of this work 
will be simplified.

Foreword ^ 


I am fully convinced that devotees thirsty for bhakti — both 
those who are rasika and bhāvuka, as well as those practitioners 
of rāgānugā-bhakti who are eager for vraja-rasa — will deeply 
cherish this book. Faithful readers will gain entrance into Šrī 
Caitanya Mahāprabhu's prema-dharma (eternal religion of 
pure, transcendental love for $ri Krsna) by studying this book. 

In conclusion, may my most worshipful Srila Gurupāda- 
padma, the very embodiment of the Supreme Lord's com- 
passion, shower abundant mercy upon me. By his doing so, my 
qualification to fulfil his innermost desire through my service 
may eternally increase. This is my humble entreaty at his divine 
feet, which can bestow prema. 

This first edition was completed in haste, so it may contain 
minor typographical errors. We request the faithful reader 
to inform us of these errors so we can correct them in future 
editions of this work. 


Praying for the particle of mercy from Šrī Hari, Guru 
and the Vaisnavas, 

Humble and insignificant, 

Tridandibhiksu Srī Bhaktivedanta Nārāyaņa

er Šrī Rādhā-krsņa-gaņoddeša-dīpikā 


I (Sri Rūpa Gosvāmī) have gathered all the well-known 
information about the associates of Sri Krsna and Srimati 
Radhika, the King and Queen of Vrndavana, that is available 
in the area of Mathura, in histories told by general people from 
generation to generation, in various scriptures such as the 
Puranas and āgama-šāstras, and in the knowledge gathered by 
the devotees currently in the assemblies of the sādhus. Based 
on this information, 1 will systematically and concisely describe 
the different groups of the eternally perfected residents of 
Vraja, as is favourable for the path of rāga. I am doing this for 
the pleasure of my well-wisher (Sri Sanātana Gosvami). May 
an attachment for Sri Radha, Sri Krsna and Their associates 
awaken in everyone by this description. (3—5) 


Sri Krsna’s Family (sri-krsnasya parivarah) 


te krsnasya parīvārā ye janā vraja-vāsinah 
pašu-pālās tathā viprā bahisthas ceti te tridha (6) 


The residents of Vraja are actually Sri Krsņa's family 
members. This family of His consists of three groups: the 
herdsmen (pašu-pālas), the priestly class (viprās) and the 
artisans (bahisthas). (6) 


1. Herdsmen (pasu-palah) 
pašu-pālās tridhā vaisya ābhīrā gurjarās tathā 
gopa-ballava-paryāyā yadu-varnša-samudbhavāh (7) 
The herdsmen are further divided into three groups: 
vaišyas, ābhīras and gurjaras. They are descendants of the Yadu 


dynasty and are known by such appropriate names as Gopa and 


Ballava. (7) 


Brhad-bhaga- 


a. vaisyas (vaisyah) 


prāyo go-vrttayo mukhyā vaisyà iti samiritah 
anye nulomajāh kecid ābhīrā iti visrutah (8) 


The vaisyas generally maintain themselves by taking care 
of cows. They are considered to be superior to the ābhīras and 
gurjaras. The vai$yas whose father belongs to a higher social 
class and mother to a lower are also known as ābhīras. (8) 


b. abhiras (abhirah) 


ācārādyena tat-sāmyād abhiras ca smrtā ime 
ābhīrāh šūdra-jātīyā go-mahisādi-vrttayah 
ghosādi-sabda-paryāyāh pūrvato nyūnatām gatāh (9) 


The ābhīras are similar to the vaišyas in customs and 
behaviour. They belong to the šūdras and maintain their life by 
taking care of cows, buffaloes and other animals, and are also 
known by the name Ghosa. The ābhīras are considered slightly 
inferior to the aforementioned vaisyas. (9) 


c. gurjaras (gurjarah) 


kificid abhirato nyūnās chāgādi-pašu-vrttayah 
gostha-prānta-krtāvāsāh pustanga gurjarāh smrtah (10) 


The gurjaras are herdsmen who live at the outskirts of 
the pasturing grounds! and who take care of goats and other 
animals. They are somewhat inferior to the ābhīras and are 
often strong and robust. (10) 


1 Here, ‘pasturing grounds’ refer to Nanda-Vraja — in other words, any 
place where Nanda Bābā used to reside with his family, cows, and the 
other gopas and gopis. 


ar Sri Radha-Krsna-ganoddesa-dipika 


2. The priestly class (brahmanas) (viprah) 


sarva-veda-vido viprà yājanādy-adhikāriņah (11) 


The brāhmaņas know all the Vedas and are engaged in the 
following six duties: performing sacrifices, engaging others in 
performing sacrifices, studying, teaching, giving charity and 
accepting charity. (11) 


3. Craftsmen (bahisthah) 
bahisthah kāravah proktā nānā-šilpopajīvinah (12) 


Craftsmen, who maintain their lives by various kinds of 
trades and crafts, are known as bahisthas. (12) 


[The aforementioned groups are further divided into 
eight: ] 
ebhih pafica-vidhair eva parīvārā harer iha 
pūjyā bhratr-bhaginy-adyà dūtyo dāsāś ca šilpinah 
dāsikās ca vayasyāš ca preyasyas ceti te 'stadha (13) 


Brhad-bhaga- 


These five groups within Sri Krsna’s family (vaisyas, ābhīras, 
gurjaras, vipras and bahisthas) are further divided into eight. 
They are: honourable elders, brothers-and-sisters and so forth, 
messengers, servants, craftsmen, maidservants, friends of the 
same age and beloveds. (13) 


Personalities honoured by Sri Krsna (pūjyāh) 


mànya bhrātrādayas tasya vayasyāh sevakadayah 
Srī-gostha-yuva-rājasya preyasyas ca purah kramat (14) 


The brothers of Sri Krsna, the Crown Prince of Vraja; His 
contemporary friends; servants and so forth; and His beloved 
gopis are all respected by Him. (14) 

pūjyāh pitā-mahādyās ca tathā jfieya mahisurah

mangalāmrta-parjanyah parjanyo nāma ballavah 
varistho vraja-gosthīnām sa krsnasya pitamahah (16) 


Šrī Krsņa's paternal and maternal grandfathers, the 
brāhmaņas and other such elders are worshipful to Him. The 
name of Sri Krsna’s paternal grandfather is Parjanya (cloud) 
because he showers torrents of auspicious nectar. His bodily 
complexion resembles molten gold and both his hair and 
clothing are of white colour. Grandfather Sri Parjanya is the 
object of veneration to all in Vraja. (15—16) 


yah surarser nidesena laksmī-bharttur ūpāsanām 
purā nandīšvare cakre $restha-santati-kanksayà 
vāg-amūrttā tate vyomni prādurāsīt priyankarī (17) 


In bygone times, Sri Parjanya lived in the area of Nandisvara. 
He wished to beget illustrious offspring, so following the 


er Šrī Rādhā-krsņa-gaņoddeša-dīpikā 


instructions of Devarsi Narada he worshipped Sri Narayana, 
the husband of Laksmi-devi. After performing austerities for 
a long time, Parjanya Maharaja heard a most pleasant divine 
voice from the heights of the sky. The voice said, (17) 


"tapasānena dhanyena bhāvinah pafica te sutāh 
variyan madhyamas tesam nanda nāmnā bhavisyati (18) 


nandanas tasya vijayī bhavitā vraja-nandanah 
surāsura-sikhā-ratna-nīrājita-padāmbujah” (19) 


“O Parjanya, five sons will be born to you as a result of 
your most excellent austerities. The best of them will be the 
middle one. He will be famous by the name Nanda. The son of 
this Nanda will be victorious in the entire world and bestow 
joy in the land of Vraja. Both the demigods and the demons 
will worship His lotus feet with the jewels decorating their 


heads." (18—19) 


tustas tatra vasann atra preksya kešinam āgatam 
parīvāraih samar sarvair yayau bhito brhad-vanam (20) 


With a happy heart Sri Parjanya resided in the area of 
Šrī Nandīšvara for some time, but when he heard about the 
Kešī demon's arrival there, he became fearful and moved to 
Mahāvana (Gokula) with his entire family. (20) 


pitāmahī mahī-mānyā kusumbhābhā harit-patā 
variyasiti vikhyātā kharvā ksīrābha-kuntalā (21) 


Šrī Krsņa's paternal grandmother is Varīyasī. She is most 
revered throughout Vraja-maņdala. Her bodily complexion 
resembles the colour of the orange-red kusumbha flower 
(safflower) and her garments are green. She is short and her 
hair is completely white as milk. (21) 


Brhad-bhaga-

natī-suverjanākhyāpi pitāmaha-sahodarā (22) 


guņavīrah patir yasyāh sūryasyāhvaya-pattanam (23a) 


Šrī Krsna's father, $ri Nanda Mahārāja, has two paternal 
uncles named Urjanya and Rājanya. They are both cowherd 
men by occupation. Suverjanā, who is expert in the art of dance 
and therefore is famous by the name Nati (dancer), is the sister 
of Šrī Krsna's paternal grandfather. She is, in other words, 
Šrī Nanda Mahārāja's paternal aunt. Suverjana's husband is 
named Gunavira, and they reside at Sürya-kunda. (22-232)

Šrī Krsna's father is $ri Nanda Mahārāja. He is worshipped 
throughout the world and is the source of happiness to the 
residents of Vraja. He has a big belly, his bodily complexion is 
like sandalwood paste (candana), and his dress resembles the 
colour of the yellowish red bandhujiva flower. He is tall and his 
beard resembles the colour of sesame seeds mixed with rice, or 
in other words, a mixture of white and black. (23b—24) 


upanandānujo nando vasudeva-suhrttamah 
goparāja-yašode ca krsņa-tātau vrajesvarau (25) 


Šrī Nanda is the younger brother of Upananda and a close 
friend of Vasudeva. Goparaja Nanda and Yasodà are Sri Krsņa's 
father and mother, and they are also widely known as the King 


and Queen of Vraja. (25)

nāmedam gārude proktam mathurā-mahima-krame 
vrsabhānur vraje khyāto yasya priya-suhrd-varah (27) 


Sri Nanda Mahārāja's friend is called Vasudeva because he 
is radiant with piety, jewels and wealth, which are all denoted 
by the word vasu. Visuddha sattva-guna, or the transcendental 
platform of pure existence, is also called vasudeva, and according 
to this meaning his name is Vasudeva because he is endowed 
with this visuddha sattva-guna. He is a partial manifestation of 
a Vasu called Drona and is also well known by the name Anaka 
Dundubhi. 

A description of these names is found in the Mathurā- 
mahatmya of the Garuda Purana. The renowned Sri Vrsabhānu 
Maharaja of Vraja is Sri Vasudeva Maharaja’s most dear 


friend. (26—27) 


mata gopa-yaso-datri ya$odà šyāmala-dyutih 
mūrttā vatsalatevdsau šakra-cāpa-nibhāmbarā (28) 


Because she gives (dā) fame (yaša) to the society of the 
cowherds, Sri Krsņa's mother is called Yašodā. Her bodily 
complexion is blackish blue ($yamala). She is the very 
personification of parental love and her attire is colourful like 


the rainbow. (28)

aindavi kīrttidā yasyah priya prāņa-sakhī varā (29) 


Šrī Yasoda's body is of medium size — neither plump nor 
thin. Her hair is quite long and black. Her best friends, who are 
as dear to her as her own life, are Aindavi and Kirttida. (29) 


gokuladhisa-grhini ya$odà devaki-sakhi

raja Sri Nanda Maharaja; as Yašodā; as a friend of Šrī Vasudeva's 
wife Šrī Devakī; as Gopesvari (the Queen of the cowherds); 
as Gostharānī (the Queen of Vraja) and as the mother of Sri 
Krsna. (30) 


According to the Ādi Purāņa 


"dve nāmni nanda-bhāryāyā yašodā devakīti ca 
atah sakhyam abhūt tasyā devakyā šauri-jāyayā” (31) 


“Sri Nanda Mahārāja's wife has two names: Yašodā and 
Devakī. Devakī, the wife of Sauri Srī Vasudeva, has the same 
name as Yašodā, and therefore they naturally have a special 


friendship.” (31)

The bodily complexion of Nandana is like the colour of the 
throat of the peacock and his clothes resemble the colour of an 
oleander flower (caņdāta). Šrī Nandana lives together with his 
father, $ri Parjanya Mahārāja, and has gentle love for Srī Hari. 
His wife's name is Atulya. Her complexion resembles light- 
ning and her clothes are like the blackish blue colour of rain

both would give their sons, like Nanda. For this reason, in Sri

charming and fascinating activities of these sakhis, and thus

A Description of the Eight Prominent Sakhis 
(asta-sakhi-caritam) 


(The eight prominent sakhis are already portrayed in this 
book. It is, nevertheless, essential to note here that earlier the 
descriptions dealt with their looks, family and so forth, but now 
the services performed by them and by the sakhis under their 
guidance will be described.)

Šrī Lalita knows perfectly well all of Sri Radha's and Sri 
Krsņa's transcendental emotions. She arranges both Their

When loving guarrels as well as arrogant words, retorts and 
arguments take place, Sri Lalita sometimes becomes filled with 
great anger, and sometimes, when her sentiments become one 
with Srī Radha's, she lowers her face [accepting Rādhā's mood]. 
At that time, she becomes covered by her friend Sri Radha's 
effulgent complexion, which is like molten gold, although her 
own complexion resembles gorocana. (131)

herself arranges [Sri Radha’s] meetings with Krsna, but when 
the time of meeting comes, she becomes indifferent. (132—133a)

it is also known as Puspapāra!. It is even more valued than the 
best of jewels. Sri Lalita Sakhī learned to expertly make them

of turmeric, and she also wears clothes of that same colour. In

Gauri Sakhi's complexion is like the colour of a peahen. 
She wears white clothes all the time. She uses words that appear 
harsh but are actually sweet, and that is why Sri Krsna calls her 
Sitakhandi. 

The word sitā means ‘sugar candy’, which by nature is hard 
and sharp. The meaning is that even though sugar candy feels 
hard within the mouth, when it goes down in the throat and in 
the stomach, it cools the body and reveals its sweetness. In the 
same way, Gauri Sakhi externally seems to speak harsh words, 
but within her heart she is sweet and gentle. This is why she is 
known as Sitakhandi. (210)

a blackish ($yama) bee and her attire is golden like lightning. 
Externally she seems very pleasing to one's mind, but because

[cāru = lovely, candi = an enraged woman]. (211)

Līlāvatī, Sādhikā, Candrikā, Mādhavī, Lalitā, Vijayā, Gaurī 
and Nandā. (250) 


Names of the eight sakhīs mentioned in another part of 
the same Sammohana Tantra (anyās cāstau) 


kalāvatī rasavatī $rimati ca sudhāmukhī 
visàkha kaumudī madhavi šāradā cāstamī smrtā (251) 


Kalāvatī, Rasavatī, Srimati, Sudhāmukhī,  Visakha,

asankhyanam ganayitum din-matram iha daršitam (252) 


The group of sakhis (named Ratnabhava) mentioned in 
the Sammohana Tantra has not been neglected in this literary 
work; they are all counted among the eternal sakhis. 

The family of the King and Queen of Vrndāvana, Šrī 
Radha and Sri Krsna, is unlimited, so counting can only give 
the reader an idea of their actual number. (252)

and tāmbula (betel nut) and who swing the swing, apply tilakas 


67 


er Šrī Rādhā-krsņa-gaņoddeša-dīpikā 


and perform many other similar services, but whose names have 
not been mentioned in this literary work. Pure devotees expert 
in relishing rasa will themselves find the names of various 
other associates [of Sri Radha and Sri Krsna] from many other 
scriptures. For them these associates are worthy of meditating 


upon. (253) 


luptatam āsīt krpayd jyotir ghatayeva bhānumaty dsau 
rūpa-visayāpi drstih sarasān Sabdan avaiksista (254) 


When darkness pervades, the faculty of seeing forms and 
other objects gets ineffective, but when the moon or the sun 
arises, one’s ability to see things is resumed. From one point of 
view, the darkness-like influence of time has similarly caused 
the names, forms and other aspects of Sri Radha’s and Sri 
Krsna’s associates to become unmanifest, but these features, 
which are like a grand festival for the eyes, have now manifested 
again in the form of words, caused by the effulgent light of the 
Supreme Lord’s mercy. (254) 


Sake drgasva-sakre, nabhasi nabhomani-dine sastyam 
vrajapati-sadmani rādhā-krsņa-gaņoddeša-dīpikā-dīpi (255) 


The word sake refers to the Sakabda Era. According to 
the rule ‘ankasya vāmā gatih — the course of the numbers are 
to the left’, the phrase drgasva-sakre makes 1472.18 The word 
nabhasa (rainy season) indicates the month of Sravana, the 
word nabhomani indicates ‘sun’, the word dina indicates ‘day’ 
18 A particular system to indicate dates was used during Sri Rapa 

Gosvāmīs time. The number 1472 can be inferred from the words drka, 

ašva and $akra in the following way. Drka means ‘sight’, and because 

there are two eyes, the word drka denotes the number two. Ašva 

(horse) refers to number seven because the Sungod has seven horses. 


Sakra means Indra, and because there are fourteen Indras in one day of 
Brahma, the word šakra denotes number fourteen. 


68 


Brhad-bhāga sēj 


and the word sastyām indicates 'sixth'. In this way, one can 
conclude that Sri Rādhā-krsņa-ganoddeša-dīpikā was completed 
in year 1472 of the Sakabda Era, in the sixth day of the month of 
Šravaņa, on Sunday, in Šrī Nanda Maharaja’s beautiful home 
Nandagrama (vrajapati-sadmani). (255)

15 


er Šrī Rādhā-krsņa-gaņoddeša-dīpikā 


Because Sri Nanda and Yasoda were terrified of the wicked 
Kamsa, they appointed the aforementioned suhrt-sakhās, 
beginning with Subhada, to protect their sons Sri Krsna and 
Sri Balarama, who are more dear to them than millions of their 
own lives. (23—25)

Among all of these priya-sakhās, Bhadrasena is the

though he is as qualified as the nāyaka himself (Jaiva-dharma, Chapter

these priya-narma-sakhās do not know. 

Of the priya-narma-sakhās, Madhumangala, Puspānka, 
Hasanka and others are Sri Krsņa's vidüsakas?. Šrīmān 
Sanandana is drowned in the happiness of his affectionate 
friendship with Srī Krsna. The priya-narma-sakhā called 
Ujjvala is as greatly effulgent (ujjvala) as Rasarāja (the king 
of transcendental mellows) personified. Even Sri Krsna, who 
is the crown jewel of all revellers of pastimes (vilāsa), becomes 
enchanted by his pastimes. (42—43) 


2 The vidūsakas are fond of eating and quarrelling; they are experts 
in flirtatious gestures and in clever speech; and they are talented in 
dressing themselves up in a funny manner (Jaiva-dharma, Chapter 32).

to Šrīmatī Radha than Her own life, that it can be compared to 
the amount one gets when multiplying the number parārddha 
[one half of Brahma’s life span]!* with itself. 

The significance here is that Sri Radha’s love for Sri Krsna 
is unlimited times more than even the sum resulting from multi- 
plying unlimited parārddha with unlimited parārddha. In other 
words, no one can imagine how much She loves Him. (144)

ten makes ten, ten multiplied by ten makes one hundred (Sata), one 
hundred multiplied by ten makes a thousand (sahasra), one thousand

by ten makes one hundred thousand (laksa), one hundred thousand

multiplied by ten makes antya, antya multiplied by ten makes madhya 
and madhya multiplied by ten makes parārddha (two parārddhas is the 
life span of Lord Brahmā of 311 trillion 40 billion years).

sixteen wives (the sixteen aspects of the moon [full moon]).
